# sheecache
A  distributed caching library for GO

Inspired by [groupcache](https://github.com/golang/groupcache) and [memcached](https://memcached.org/), sheecache is a distributed caching library for GO that is easy to use and deploy. It is designed to be used in a microservices architecture where multiple services can share a common cache.
